<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Lux. I am an aspiring programmer who is using 2024 to begin my coding journey. I started self teaching last year, but i am now taking this a lot more seriously. I have begun learning HTML, CSS with bootstrap, and Javascript. I love coding and learning.</p>

<h2>My life prior to coding</h2>
<p>I have always believed myself to be a lifelong learner. I love learning new skills and love to challenge myself. However, in the last few years, I've found myself feeling stagnant.</p>

<p>It took me quite a while to figure out why. I am a dog groomer. I love my job and I love my clients. However, I had stopped actively learning. My brain was beginning to get bored. I knew that I needed to give myself a new goal and find a job where learning was a neccisity to continue succeeding. That's when I found coding. </p>

<p>I jumped in head first. I began using youtube to teach myself the beginning of HTML and CSS. I am loving it so far and cant wait to discover how far I can go within the coding world.</p>
